# BMI
This repository contains of a python code which helps calculate BMI i.e; Body mass Index of a person when their height and weight is provided in either Imperial system or metric system. 
Important information to note is that the Body Mass Index doesnt calculate the ratio keeping in mind the lean mass of the body. 
BMI is not the measure of fat in the body but the measure of the healthy weight to height.
